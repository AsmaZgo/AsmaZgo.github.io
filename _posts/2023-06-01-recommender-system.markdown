# **A Recommander System Architecture Design**

As a second blog post of a serie about Machine Learning system design i propose this simple architecture for the training and maintaining a recommender system for video sharing platforms like Youtube.

This ML system design problem is composed of two big building blocks: 

-Offline component for training and validating the recommender model

-Online component for generating (inferring) recommendations
